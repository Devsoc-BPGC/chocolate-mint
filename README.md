### Commit Messages

1. Commit messages are communication and documentation. They're a log of more than just _what_ happened, they're about _why_ it was done.
1. The longer a project is active, the more people involved, the larger the codebase, the more important it is to have good commit messages.
1. Make sure every change that you make is well documented and is included in your commit message.
1. **One** commit should have only **one** change. (A change may include multiple file changes that are essential to solving the issue/change).
1. All commit messages should be in the imperative-present tense. After all, you are telling us what you have _already_ done.

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. The subject line should be a one-sentence summary, and should not include
   the word _and_ (explicitly or implied).
1. Any extra detail should be provided in the body of the PR.
1. Don't submit unrelated changes in the same pull request.
